                <p>One of the most intriguing reasons we have discovered for our customers to choose a SalDan built
                    home in their quest for the perfect house is what we call “The second time buyers phenomenon”.
                    Over the past 40 years we have learned a great deal from our thousands of customers. We know a
                    second time home buyer is an extremely educated consumer. That’s why we’re always proud when
                    second time buyers choose SalDan Developments for their next home.</p>
                <p>Happily it is a very common occurrence that more than 80% of our customers are second time home
                    buyers. As a matter of fact we have entire families of return customers who have owned our homes
                    previously and now bring their children to buy.</p>
                <p>Simply put, they want the trouble free home and a terrific return on their investment. The
                    trouble free home, a terrific return on their investment upon resale combined with the
                    innovative construction methods employed by the longtime trades people and fine craftsmen that
                    produce a SalDan home, our premier neighbourhoods give our customers beneficial advantages when
                    reselling.</p>
                <p>Of course, a solid problem free home is only the first step. All the wonderful options that are
                    available and the countless customer options we provide will turn ownership into a more
                    enjoyable, more relaxing and visually appealing experience.</p>
                <p>We sincerely hope you enjoy everything that our website has to offer in presenting some of the
                    many options SalDan Developments offers.</p>
