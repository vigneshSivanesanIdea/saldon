          One of the most intriguing reasons we have discovered for our
          customers to choose a SalDan built home in their quest for the perfect
          house is what we call “The second time buyers phenomenon”. Over the
          past 40 years we have learned a great deal from our thousands of
          customers. We know a second time home buyer is an extremely educated
          consumer. That’s why we’re always proud when second time buyers choose
          SalDan Developments for their next home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Happily it is a very common occurrence that more than 80% of our
          customers are second time home buyers. As a matter of fact we have
          entire families of return customers who have owned our homes
          previously and now bring their children to buy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply put, they want the trouble free home and a terrific return on
          their investment. The trouble free home, a terrific return on their
          investment upon resale combined with the innovative construction
          methods employed by the longtime trades people and fine craftsmen that
          produce a SalDan home, our premier neighbourhoods give our customers
          beneficial advantages when reselling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, a solid problem free home is only the first step. All the
          wonderful options that are available and the countless customer
          options we provide will turn ownership into a more enjoyable, more
          relaxing and visually appealing experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We sincerely hope you enjoy everything that our website has to offer
          in presenting some of the many options SalDan Developments offers.
